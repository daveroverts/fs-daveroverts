### Online flying / ATC
All my flights are flown on the [VATSIM network](https://www.vatsim.net/).

Next to flying, I'm also a controller currently holding both C3 and I1 ratings. My home division is the [Dutch VACC](https://www.dutchvacc.nl).

Usually, you will find me controlling EHAA_CTR, which covers the Netherlands.
