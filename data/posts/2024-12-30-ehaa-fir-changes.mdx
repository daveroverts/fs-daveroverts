_Please note that this post has **not** been created by the Dutch VACC staff. I decided to create this to prevent some confusion while awaiting the official announcement_

### Introduction

Starting from AIRAC 2413, the Dutch VACC has made some changes on how the position 'Amsterdam Radar' [EHAA_CTR] is being staffed. It has been quite busy in the EHAA FIR lately, and we want to provide better service to inbound and outbound traffic.

### The old situation

Previously, the first position to open up is EHAA_W_CTR. When no other EHAA where online, this position is responsible for the whole EHAA FIR [GND - FL245], and the Maastricht Delta Sector [FL245 - FL660].

It seems that even during regular evenings, it has become too busy to handle overflights in the Maastricht Delta Sector. This is especially the case when there's no Schiphol Approach controller online. In practice, when we don't need to speak to an overflight (no next sector), we just leave them on UNICOM.

### The new situation

Starting from AIRAC 2413, two new positions have been introduced:

**EHAA_LOW_CTR [125.750]**

This position now only covers the EHAA FIR from the ground up to FL245, **excluding** the Maastricht Delta sector.

**EHAA_ALL_CTR [134.375]**

This position covers the whole EHAA FIR, **including** the Maastricht Delta sector.
